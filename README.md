# RevomApp
A mapping tool designed for Revomazes
## Keys to do things:
P: Create a new ***P***ath

D: ***D***elete the current path

N: select the ***N***ext path

## What does layer mean?
If two paths lay on top of each other, the layer determines which path will be rendered on top. So a path with the layer 5 will be rendered over a path with the layer 4. This can be useful for traps and such.
